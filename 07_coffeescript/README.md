# [Day 7](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/7) in CoffeeScript

I don't have a lot of time today, so I decided to solve today's puzzle in a
language I actually knew once: CoffeeScript.

The first question is simple: which name occurs on the left, but not on the
right? But I'm going to be building the complete graph structure, because I
have a feeling I might need it in the second part.
