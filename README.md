# Polyglot Advent of Code 2017

[Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) is a programming contest,
in which a new puzzle comes online every day from 1 until 25 December. These
are my solutions to the puzzles. Like
[last year](https://github.com/ttencate/aoc2016), I'm solving each day's puzzle
in a different programming language. As an additional additional challenge, I'm
not using any language I used last year!

## Languages

I'm using only "mainstream" programming languages, not esoteric or toy
languages, because this will be hard enough as is. However, I do include some
older languages in the list out of historic interest. Plus, a free (as in beer)
implementation for Linux has to exist.

Languages I might still use, roughly in order of decreasing preference (based
both on what I know, and what might be suitable for such puzzles):

* Java
* PHP
* BASIC
* Clojure
* Elixir
* CoffeeScript
* Dart
* Nim
* REBOL
* Forth
* F#
* Kotlin
* Octave
* Erlang
* Icon
* Eiffel
* Prolog
* CUDA
* GLSL
* TCL
* Smalltalk
* Julia
* AWK
* J
* APL
* Ada
* Algol
* 6502 assembly

## Rules

* Input should be read from stdin if at all possible. Otherwise, read from a
  file named `input`.
* The input file must be read and parsed exactly as provided. No modifications
  are allowed.
