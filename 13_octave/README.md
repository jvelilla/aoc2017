# [Day 13](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/13) in Octave

Some of my friends commented that they did today's puzzle in Matlab, so this
must be a great day to use Matlab's open-source cousin, Octave.

Reading input using `scanf` is delightfully simple, although it seems to read
all numbers rather than just one line. Fine with me!
